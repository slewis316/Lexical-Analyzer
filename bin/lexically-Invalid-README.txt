This file was created with the intention of including lexically invalid symbols/numbers for the program to analyze and detect.
The first error encountered should be a "!" which the program should detect, terminate analysis, and report the invalid token to the user.
The correct symbol in this case would be "!=" but there is another error present in the lower section of the code, a symbol "=:" which will 
also perform the same error procedure as the error above.
